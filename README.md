### Homicide Scraper
<b>By</b>: <em>Jos√© Luis Adriano</em>

Script which scrapes crime incidents data from Dallas Police's Open Data Portal and combines it with data we've obtained via public records requests every day. The code also triggers a Slack alert every time there is a new murder in the incidents data.
